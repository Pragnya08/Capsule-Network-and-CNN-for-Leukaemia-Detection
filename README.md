# Capsule-Network-and-CNN-for-Leukaemia-Detection

Project Overview: 
This repository features the development and validation of two distinct deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Capsule Networks (CapsNets). Each model is implemented separately to explore their individual capabilities in detecting and classifying Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) from microscopic images of biological tissues.

Objective: 
The aim of this project is to assess and compare the performance of CNNs and CapsNets in a medical imaging context, focusing on their ability to accurately detect leukemia cells.

Data:
The dataset comprises high-resolution microscopic images, annotated to indicate the presence of ALL cells. These images serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the models.

Setup and Installation:
Required Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Repository Contents: 
- CNN_Leukemia.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation and evaluation of the CNN model.
- CapsNet_Leukemia.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for the Capsule Network model implementation and evaluation.

Running the Project:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install all necessary libraries as outlined in the Setup and Installation section.
- Open and run the respective Jupyter Notebooks to view the implementation and performance of each model.

Key Findings:
- Both models were evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
- Comparative analysis between CNN and CapsNets highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of medical imaging.

Future Directions:
This project opens avenues for further research in improving the generalization capabilities of hybrid models and exploring their applications in other complex medical imaging tasks.
